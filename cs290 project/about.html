      <p class="greeting"><strong>Hi there!</strong></p>

      <p>My name is Abby. I am a full-time lawyer and a part-time photographer, though I am lucky enough to get equal
        joy
        from both. My hobbies include hiking, traveling, and hanging out with my husband and pups. I am currently based
        in
        Redding, California but I’ve lived in San Diego, the Bay Area, Oregon, and Burkina Faso (It’s a country in
        Africa.
        Don’t worry, most people haven’t heard of it.) I love carne asada burritos and pepperoni pizza, and I am
        constantly
        craving both. But more importantly...</p>

      <p>I love taking photos and I have for a very long time. Before fancy camera equipment was available to average
        people
        like me, I fueled my love for taking photos with disposable cameras, digital cameras, and yes, my first flip
        phone.
        I’ve moved on to better equipment, but my love for taking photos has stayed the same.</p>
      <p>I am a firm believer that every family should have photos from treasured moments in life. Whether those
        treasured
        moments are watching a child grow up, celebrating a milestone, or maybe even just taking pictures for the
        holiday
        card, I want to help families capture those moments. My goal is to provide families with quality photos for an
        affordable price. </p>
